![Maksym Stobetskyi]({{ 'Max.jpg' | prepend: '/assets/img/' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Hi, my name is Maksym.

I do programming for leaving, mainly focused on iOS/OSX. Working for great company [Readdle](https://readdle.com).

When I am too frustrated with current Mac stack, I type M-x cider-jack-in to feel the joy of Clojure.
My interests are in reverse engeneering, cryptography, machine learning. 
Passionate about keyboards/text-editors, can't stand inefficiency. Every time new XCode/OSX comes out and my tools stop working, something dies in me.

Blogging about things I find interesting and worth sharing. There is an xml feed, in case someone still uses it, and my contacts on the right.

That's my son Kirill in the header. He can speek with his eyebrow, just like his mother and my wife Kate.
